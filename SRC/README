compilation options:

ANSI_TERMINAL
enables ANSI screen control codes

PC_TERMINAL
enables screen control codes suited for PC

If neither of above are #defined, no screen control codes are
printed. The compiler will warn about some empty strings, but
you can safely ignore these warnings.
Also, if screen control codes are disabled, 3MU will always
behave as if the command line option -j 0 had been specified.
Therefore no process indication is currently possible on
terminals without screen controlling possible.

By default, ANSI_TERMINAL is enabled when compiled on an AMIGA or unix,
and PC_TERMINAL is enabled on a MSDOS thing.
