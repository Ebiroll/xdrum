This is a rellay old program that requires OSS or a gravis ultrasound card.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravis_Ultrasound

It is possible to compile with ALSA oss 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#OSS_compatibility


pacman -S libxaw


On arch linux with ALSA I got it to run as follows

make stereo

As root,
pacman -S libxaw

modprobe snd_seq_oss
modprobe -v snd_pcm_oss
modprobe -v snd_mixer_oss


What is xdrum?
==============
Xdrum is an X-windows based drum machine with Athena widgets.
It uses VoxWare and supports any sound-card with an 
/dev/dsp device. Preferably 16-bits, but can be compiled for
8-bits. It also supports GUS, which makes it run really comfortably.
It comes with a small collection of raw data samples and
can be extended with you own raw data 44 kHz samples.

Linn drum samples
=================
Some drumpacks refer to these samples.

GUS
===
Gravis ultrasound soundcard,

Revision history,

1.5 28/9 -96 (DRUMS_ROOT patch by mnalis@jagor.srce.hr)

   Also digital delay was added. I know that the scroll controls 
   doesnt pop up with the proper settings. If you want to play with the delay 
   controls, let them stay active (dont push OK). 
   Just move them somewhere else on the screen. 	

   As an extra bonus. When loading or saving a song, You can push return and
   start load/save. Prior version inserted \r in filename. Used to be annoying.	

HOW TO Compile
=============

(1) make  [gus|other|stereo|alsa]

sudo apt install libasound2-dev


This will work fine in most cases. Otherwise you must modify something.
Most probably the makefile.
The /usr/X11R6/include part in the makefile should probably be replaced.
Also you can replace \"`pwd`"\ with the directory where you want to put your
samples and songs. (i.e. \"/home/olaas/xdrum\")

 
If you only have an 8-bit soundcard, put comments around:
#define SC16BITS 
In the file sbdrum.c


If you have a GUS card try making a symbolic link named patch to /dos/ultrasnd/midi or
wherever you store your .pat files. This way you can use the DRUMS.GUS file
by typing cp DRUMS.GUS DRUMS.


THE GUI (Users guide)
=======================

You will figure it out quickly. Just try to remember that
1) Every pattern is named after a key on the keyboard.
2) Use only the letters.
3) If you press SHIFT-and-key then the present pattern is copied
into the new pattern. 
4) You MUST have the pointer in the field for all the drums or in the 
beat field when you change the pattern with the keyboard.
5) The first play-button is for pattern play. The second play-button
is for songplay.
6) Newline in song is not played. (Just don't use two consecutive newlines.)
7) Press patt: to get an overview of pattern

Easy GUI modifications (DRUMS file)
==================================

If you want to change the name of a drum. Modify the DRUMS file.
Be careful and follow this format:
1) Name of button
2) <tab>
3) filename to load
4) <tab>
5) Column number.. Must be an increasing number (In order). 1-6..
6) <tab>
7) PAN -128 to 128 (affects GUS version only)
8) <tab>
9) Volume (Not implemented yet.)
10) <tab>
11) 1=Intel format file, 0=Motorola format, 7=Patch file format (GUS Users) 
If your 44 kHz samples make a lot of noise. Try changing the last number.
If it doesnt help its probably not raw data samples.
9) <tab>
10) Assign key. (GUS only)
12) <newline>

If you have entered the numbers correctly you will have something that
looks like:

LoKick	samples/LoKick	1	-20	1	1	60
Snare	samples/RSnare	2	30	1	1	60



If you have a gus card you might want to try:

Steel	patch/steeldrm.pat	2	30	1	7	60

The 7 at the end tells the program that this is a patchfile. 
The 60 at the very end is where the sample should be played.(60=Middle C)
